# python_EDA_visualizations

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the US_Lighting_Forest dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about lighting installations, forest characteristics, or environmental data — depending on the dataset's actual contents — using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing or inconsistent values

Parsed and formatted date, category, or location data as needed

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized key distributions (histograms, box plots, bar charts)

Identified trends, correlations, and outliers

Grouped data by relevant categories (e.g., lighting type, region, time)

Insight Generation

Analyzed relationships between environmental or installation factors

Highlighted patterns useful for policymakers, researchers, or engineers

## Tools & Libraries
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## File Included
P_EDA_ipynb.ipynb – The Jupyter Notebook containing:

Complete data processing steps

Visualization code

Commentary and insights

## Outcome
This project provides a clear overview of the trends and characteristics of the US Lighting Forest dataset. The findings can help urban planners, sustainability analysts, or environmental agencies understand lighting patterns and their implications.
